3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

    Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19

but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27

the hotel in the area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32

needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !\\n42

was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                              I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50

Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                  They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you won\\u0092t have to mess with the parking fees .\\n55

steal .\\n58                                                                                                                                      We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59                                                                                                                                                          Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                           Nice rooms, a bit on the smaller side, but parking right at the hotel .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                    staff were helpful although the valet parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .\\n62

.\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                               Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67

the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was

3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

    Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19

but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27

the hotel in the area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32

needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !\\n42

was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                              I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50

Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                  They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you won\\u0092t have to mess with the parking fees .\\n55

steal .\\n58                                                                                                                                      We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59                                                                                                                                                          Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                           Nice rooms, a bit on the smaller side, but parking right at the hotel .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                    staff were helpful although the valet parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .\\n62

.\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                               Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67

the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was

                                 I thought it would be fitting to christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                            As soon as I'd clicked the button to confirm my order it appeared on my Kindle almost immediately !\\n1                                                                                                                After reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n2                                                   I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n3

press a button to turn pages .\\n4                                                                                                                                                  It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n5

owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .\\n7

to press and hold two buttons to put the device to sleep .\\n8

                                                                                                                                                                                                          You need to press on the interior of the button to get it to click .\\n10

                                                                                                                                                                                                               The little power button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .\\n12

                                                                                                                                       sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .\\n14

.\\n15                                                                                                       Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .\\n16

button later .\\n17

                                                                                                                                               The main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                     I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The display is better and the 5, way button is a major improvement .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On off buttons are repositioned to be easily accessible .\\n22    Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The second thing is the buttons .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                           This means that when you handle the Kindle 2 by the edges, the pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .\\n25                                                                                                                                              Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .\\n26                                                                                                          That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled \\u00be of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                                     What I like most about the Kindle 2 is the placement of the buttons and their inversion .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                              It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .\\n29

get work done .\\n30                                                                                                                                      if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

page turn buttons are better .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n33

manageable size and are a lot less sensitive .\\n34

                      It took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A button click brings up the dictionary, starting with that entry .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .\\n39                                                                                                      The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Every K2 button has a satisfying \\n42                                                                                                                                       Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n43                                                                                        The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,  Inside, edge buttons ,  These have saved me from accidentally pressing buttons many times .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                               The text is darker and clearer and the buttons are more like the Sony , ,  both on one side   .\\n46

especially the improved button design .\\n47

literally impossible for people with low, vision to read .\\n49

                                            Each time this has happened, I have contacted the support team, each time the team member has made me delete the book from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .\\n53

                                               The buttons and the controller work smoothly .\\n55                                                                                           Sleek

 I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .\\n57

longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n59

the home button by accident a lot .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61

the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                            However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n63

button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65

the new buttons would be Sony Reader size, and impossible for me to press .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like the new size and feel of the buttons .\\n68

                  But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n70

   Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73

 buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n83

with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\n89

detracts from your reading .\\n90

that I will get over the loss quickly .\\n92

the buttons without turning the page accidentally .\\n94                                                                                                          They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .\\n95                                                                                                                                    Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n96

the lst generation that made the device hard to hold and frustratingly easy to advance the page .\\n100

                          I also like the fact the button is on the top and not on the back as it was on the K1 .\\n102

rotate, which makes some PDFs readable but then you're in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .\\n110

                   While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .\\n112

way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113

                                            What remains to be seen, however, is whether the Kindle 2 will be plagued with having to be reset as frequently as the Kindle, nor did I see a reset button

read technical books without any problems but I cannot read text on the Kindle without straining my eyes .\\n10

                                                                                                                                              The text clarity and screen sharpness of K2 is severely disappointing and produces eye fatigue .\\n12                                                                                                  I had old favorites, and some classics that we're told we should read, samples that had caught my eye, and lots of new choices , ,  and I held them all in my hand .\\n13  I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .\\n14                                                                                                                       And with the Kindle, I can adjust the font to any of six different sizes, which is of some importance to those with poor vision or tired eyes .\\n15

                                                                                                           I know some people are really upset about the no backlight issue, but I'm glad because it is not as straining on my eyes as a computer screen .\\n18                                                                                                                                                         I read for 2 hours in the middle of the night last night and my husband never knew, and my eyes didn't hurt .\\n19                                  Text to speech is adequate, I don't see myself using this feature too much, but it's a lot better than nothing when you need both hands free, and it would be a truly fantastic feature for anyone with poor eyesight or blindness .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,  The screen is easy on the eyes .\\n21                                                                                                                                       The screen is amazing & the one thing that kept me from reading on into the night constantly eyestrain is NO LONGER a CONCERN !\\n22

                                                                                                                                                                                      This thing is so easy on the eyes, I like it better than an actual book .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                      0 out of 5 stars A great tool for those of us with aging eyes, February 28, 2009\\n25                                                   The text, bumped up two magnification levels, is sharp and clear enough for me to make out, and while I've seen some criticism of the gray page background, I actually find it easier on my eyes than stark white .\\n26                                                                 For those of us in the Boomer bulge whose eyesight is failing and taking with it the pleasure of reading ,  and for those with other forms of visual impairment ,  it's nothing less than a miracle .\\n27                                                                                                                                         As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                     I am loving the whole concept and read almost a whole book last night with no eye strain at all .\\n29                                                                                                                                                  I have been keeping an eye on the Kindle since the first was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                    and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .\\n31

center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .\\n33                                                                                                                                            Even without the back light, within fifteen minutes of reading on the sony reader due to the glare, my eyes were hurting .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I have not experienced eye, strain .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    The illuminence of the light is equally distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                      Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .\\n37                                                                                                           And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                 First of all, the Kindle 2 is very easy on the eyes .\\n39                                                                                 Some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but I find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .\\n40                                                                                                                                  A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .\\n41                                                                                                        I won't be using the feature much anyway because I get a lot more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .\\n42



                                                                                                                                               Not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .\\n48                                                                                                                           With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .\\n49

double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !\\n141

                                         When I got to the room, I thought the new rooms would have a plasma since the website implies the new rooms would have them, but I guess those come later

                        I did notice that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $6 which I think is rediculous .\\n60

were little things like dressing gowns that were a nice touch but other everyday things let the hotel down .\\n78

                                   The bad side is that the rooms are dated and in need of some upgrades, but for $109 a night through Travelocity it was great .\\n83

  Since we were staying during busy Memorial weekend all the good rooms filled up quickly .\\n84                                                                                                                            Our family of 4 frequents Chicago and oftentime forgoes the comfort of a more spacious suite just to experience the thrill of the view of the river and Navy Pier that Swissotel's Lakeview rooms provide .\\n85

the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .\\n99                                                                                                                                        I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\n100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !\\n101

                     The hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .\\n107

stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n111                                                                                                                                               So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n112

or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don\\u0092t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n113

&quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116

unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\n117

                                                                                                                                                                     I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119

counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38



                                           The bathroom was large and private .\\n45

to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49

outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

                                                                                                                                                                                           The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

                                            Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

little dated .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                        The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

 .\\n77

mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n80

for starting the computer, other computers I have the run on Linux still start in less than 1 quarter the time that Windows 7 does .\\n11

the taskbar at the bottom as you can  pin  icons to start all of your programs and you can start a program with the desired file opening .\\n16

Vista did, I do not notice any decrease in the start, up time .\\n17

            It cost me thousands of dollars to get rid of it, but the seats gave me and my wife back pain after 20 minutes of driving !\\n11

.\\n29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                            It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

Acer .\\n15

                                                      This makes the screen much brighter and as with all new computers it seems there are always important updates .\\n17

                                    I got used to the glossy screens a while ago  this one is remarkably bright and vivid .\\n19

                                                 Now I keep getting the  blue screen  serious errors .\\n20

netbooks with screens smaller than the now, standard 10 .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                        If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n24

getting a good 8\\n25

  The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n27

  The touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .\\n31

        My only complaint with it is that the screen doesn't go back far enough .\\n32

doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

full screen display is smooth and no issues .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                       Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

configured Firefox to always run full screen mode  , surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .\\n41

far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .\\n42

that it wants to fall backwards  with the screen pushed back all the way\\n43

bright light shining down on it, you've got a choice :\\n44

eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One of the other complaints I'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51

fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .\\n53

                                      I like the gloss screen fine .\\n54

for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

conditions .\\n57



One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143

and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

           you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

                                                              Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n4

cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .\\n6                                                                                                                                         Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .\\n7                                                                                 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                      This clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .\\n10                                                                                                                           Upon plugging my Nuvi 255w in the PC for the first time, it immediately informed me of both a software update and a map update .\\n11

                                         The map update was about 2GB in size .\\n13                                                                                                                  I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .\\n14

         It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35

box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39

is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8

     but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11

directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33

can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34

entertaining and not an issue .\\n39

would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42

and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

                                                    The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46

         The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                 It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55

boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56

mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

                                                                                                                                                                                                        There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n60

bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n61

were following me for directions .\\n62

                                                                                                                             The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64

which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65

took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .\\n66

seconds .\\n67

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I was so tired of having to go to Mapquest and print out directions .\\n69

fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n70

directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The directions the GPS gave me were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n74

around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n75                                                                                                                                             I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77

                              It can be a little distracting the first few times you use it, but once you find the right mounting spot, it s like it's not there until you need it and then it's there

when necessary .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   But driving on the highway with music on and windows down, it will be hard to hear the directions using just 70% of volume .\\n95

seemed a bit confused in directions .\",\n          \"

layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n4          The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n5                                                                                The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n6

odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .\\n9                                                                                                                                             It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n10

fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12

way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16                                                                                      The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18

that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the

doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

map .\\n33                                                                                                                         The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n34

                            I use the suction cup mount because I like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .\\n36                                                                                                                                                             From the map screen it's but 2 presses on the large and accessible touchscreen to get a  Where Am I ?\\n37    I also realize that even if I crashed differently I had been injured in other ways but the car were still drivable that it's but 1 press on the screen to get direction to the nearest emergency services   from that lovely screen that told me where I was .\\n38

possibility of it sliding out .\\n43                                                                                                                                             Also, it's hard to view the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .\\n44

                                                        These gadgets have sensitive touchscreen menus, and I think the fact that I didn't protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .\\n46

screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n50                                                                                                                                        The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .\\n51

was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55

huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .\\n63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sufficiently sensitive touch screen\\n76                                                                                                                                                          Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .\\n78                                                                                                                                                           The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen size makes it really easy to see without being a safety hazard .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                    The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                       The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .\\n82

.\\n84                                                                                                                                                3 inches large screen is large enough for you to

                                       One down side is the lack of volume button on the unit you have to adjust the volume form the tool menu on the screen which can be a challenge if you want to change the volume when you are driving .\\n91                                                                                                                                                After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .\\n92

                                                                                                                                                                    The wide screen is important because of the better keyboard   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                  We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .\\n95                                                                                                                                                After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n96

larger screen .\\n97

to the fit and finish of previous Camrys   .\\n55    Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily

what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my
